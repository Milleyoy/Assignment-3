                    <p>If you have had COVID-19 you should wait to be vaccinated with your next COVID-19 vaccine 6 months after the confirmed infection.
                         This is to optimise your vaccine protection. A longer gap between infection and vaccination is likely to lead to a better immune response and result in 
                        longer protection from reinfection.
                         The next scheduled dose of COVID-19 vaccine should be given as soon as possible after 6 months.

                         If you have had COVID-19, you do not need to defer other vaccinations – for example, your flu vaccine.

                    <div class="text">
                    <p>There are many reasons why you may choose to get your child vaccinated against COVID-19.

                        It is true that most COVID-19 infections in young children either have no symptoms, or only mild symptoms. But some children do get very sick from COVID-19, or have long term complications from COVID-19. 
                        
                        Less is known about the effects of the Omicron variant in children.
                        
                        Vaccination is the best way to help prevent your child getting very sick. This is particularly important for children at greater risk.
                        
                        Another reason you might consider vaccination is because of the indirect benefits to your child.

                    <p>To receive the best protection against serious illness or death from COVID-19, you should get all the recommended doses for your age or 
                        individual health needs. Boosters are important to maintain this protection. Boosters are anticipated to address waning of protection against severe COVID-19 prior to winter.

                        All adults can get a booster if it’s been 6 months or longer since their last COVID-19 booster or confirmed infection (whichever is most recent) for additional protection 
                        against severe illness from COVID.</p>

                        What we do know is that evidence shows that all of the COVID-19 vaccines approved for use In Australia

                    <p>There is no scientific evidence to support this. None of the COVID-19 vaccines currently under review by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) cause sterilisation/infertility.

                        The TGA will not approve a vaccine for use in Australia unless it is safe and effective. This includes impacts on fertility.
                        
                        The theory that COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility is based on the disproven idea that one of the spike proteins in COVID-19 and the Syncytin-1 protein 
                        (which help placenta development) are the same. They are not.</p>

                        It may appear they have been developed very quickly, but researchers around the world have been working hard to develop COVID-19 vaccines

                        They have been able to speed up development of vaccines thanks to the collaboration between them, scientists, manufacturers and distributors.</p>

                        The COVID-19 vaccine does not protect against the flu, so you should still have your annual flu shot.
